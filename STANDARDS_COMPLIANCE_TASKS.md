## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow Replacements (High Priority)

### 1. Replace rust.yml with ci.yml

**Current Issues:**

- Single platform testing (Ubuntu only)
- No coverage reporting
- No security scanning
- Missing quality gates

**Required Implementation:**

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

    branches: [main]

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0

  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          just setup
          just test-nextest
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Lint
        run: |
          just fmt-check
          just lint

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: rust
      - uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      - name: SBOM Generation
        run: syft . -o spdx-json=sbom.json
      - name: Vulnerability Scan
        run: grype sbom.json
```

### 2. Create release-please.yml

**New File Required:**

```yaml
name: Release Please
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v4
        with:
          release-type: rust
          package-name: gold_digger
```

### 3. Complete release.yml Rewrite
