## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **TLS Migration**: Simplified to rustls-only implementation with platform certificate store integration
  - **Before**: Dual TLS implementations (`ssl` with native-tls, `ssl-rustls` with rustls-tls)
  - **After**: Single rustls-based implementation via `ssl` feature
  - **Migration**: Update build scripts to use simplified `ssl` feature

### Features
- **TLS Implementation**: Migrated to rustls-only implementation with enhanced security controls
  - Single `ssl` feature now uses `mysql/rustls-tls` with platform certificate store integration
  - Automatic system certificate store usage on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Enhanced TLS validation modes: Platform, CustomCa, SkipHostnameVerification, AcceptInvalid
  - Intelligent error messages with specific CLI flag suggestions for TLS issues
  - Security warnings for insecure TLS modes

### Documentation
- Updated comprehensive TLS configuration guide with new rustls-only model
- Updated README.md with simplified TLS implementation details
- Updated WARP.md, AGENTS.md, and GEMINI.md with new TLS architecture
