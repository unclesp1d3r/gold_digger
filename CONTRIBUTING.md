## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[gold_digger Code of Conduct](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_diggerblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to .

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the
> available [Documentation](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question
in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (Rust toolchain version, Cargo version, OS and architecture, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
  components/versions (Make sure that you have read
  the [documentation](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/wiki). If you are looking for support, you might want
  to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
  is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in
  the [bug tracker](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_diggerissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have
  discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
> tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to .

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether
  it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to
  recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
  obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs
  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such
  as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for gold_digger, **including completely new
features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the
community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/wiki) carefully and find out if the functionality
  is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been
  suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to
  convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be
  useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users,
  consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/unclesp1d3r/gold_digger/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part
  which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS
  and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast)
  or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on
  Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most gold_digger users. You may also want to point out the other
  projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

##### Distribution Testing

Gold Digger uses [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/) for cross-platform distribution:

```bash
# Install cargo-dist
just install-tools

# Test distribution configuration
just dist-check

# Plan a release (dry-run)
just dist-plan

# Build distribution artifacts locally
just dist-build

# Generate installers
just dist-generate
```

For detailed release process documentation, see the [Release Runbook](docs/src/development/release-runbook.md).

##### Release Process

For detailed release process documentation, see the [Release Runbook](docs/src/development/release-runbook.md).

**Quick local test commands:**

```bash
# Test release workflow locally
just act-release-dry v1.0.0-test

# Plan cargo-dist release
cargo dist plan

# Build artifacts locally
cargo dist build
```

##### Testing Recommendations

- Use [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) for benchmarking
- Use [insta](https://crates.io/crates/insta) for snapshot testing
- Run `cargo-llvm-cov` for coverage analysis

##### Pre-commit Hooks

Gold Digger uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. The configuration includes:

- **Code formatting**: Rust (`cargo fmt`), YAML (`prettier`), Markdown (`mdformat`)
- **Linting**: Rust (`cargo clippy`), Shell scripts (`shellcheck`), GitHub Actions (`actionlint`)
- **Security**: Dependency auditing (`cargo audit`), commit message validation (`commitizen`)

Install and run pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks for this repository
pre-commit install

# Run hooks on all files (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run hooks automatically on commit
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

#### Code Quality Standards

Before submitting any code, ensure it passes all quality gates:

- **Formatting**: `cargo fmt --check` (100-character line limit)
- **Linting**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (zero tolerance for warnings)
- **Testing**: `cargo test` (all tests must pass)
- **Security**: `cargo audit` (no known vulnerabilities)
- **Pre-commit hooks**: All hooks must pass

The pre-commit configuration automatically enforces:

- Rust code formatting and linting
- YAML/JSON formatting with Prettier
- Markdown formatting with mdformat
- Shell script validation with ShellCheck
- GitHub Actions workflow validation
- Conventional commit message format
- Documentation link checking

### Improving The Documentation

<!-- TODO
Updating, improving and correcting the documentation

-->

## Styleguides

### Code Style

Gold Digger follows strict code style guidelines enforced through automated tools:

#### Rust Code Style

- **Formatting**: Use `rustfmt` with 100-character line limit (configured in `rustfmt.toml`)
- **Linting**: Zero tolerance for clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- **Error Handling**: Use `anyhow::Result<T>` for fallible functions
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs with `///` comments
- **Feature Gates**: Use `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` for conditional compilation

#### File Formatting

- **YAML/JSON**: Formatted with Prettier
- **Markdown**: Formatted with mdformat (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
- **Shell Scripts**: Must pass ShellCheck validation
- **Line Endings**: Unix-style (LF) enforced by `.editorconfig`

### Commit Messages

Gold Digger uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for automated versioning and release management, enforced by pre-commit hooks:

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

#### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add new output format support"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve connection timeout issue"

# Breaking change (note the !)
git commit -m "feat!: migrate to new CLI interface"

# With scope
git commit -m "feat(cli): add --version flag"

# With body
git commit -m "feat: add TLS support

This adds comprehensive TLS support for secure database connections.
Uses rustls-only implementation with platform certificate store integration."
```

#### Automated Releases

cargo-dist automatically:

- Analyzes conventional commits to determine version bumps
- Creates release PRs with updated CHANGELOG.md
- Generates semantic version tags (patch/minor/major)
- Builds cross-platform artifacts and installers
- Creates GitHub releases with signed artifacts
- Integrates with the existing release workflow for artifact generation

You can test the cargo-dist workflow locally using the justfile:

```bash
# Test cargo-dist workflow (dry-run)
just dist-plan

# Build cargo-dist artifacts locally
just dist-build

# Generate installers
just dist-generate
```

#### Pre-commit Validation

The `commitizen` hook validates commit messages automatically. If your commit message doesn't follow the convention, the commit will be rejected with guidance on the correct format.

## IDE and Editor Configuration

This project uses `.editorconfig` to maintain consistent coding style across different editors and IDEs. The configuration ensures:

- UTF-8 encoding
- Unix-style line endings (LF)
- Final newline at end of files
- Trailing whitespace removal (except in Markdown files)
- Consistent indentation (4 spaces for Rust/TOML, 2 spaces for YAML/JSON)

### IDE Metadata

**JetBrains IDE files (`.idea/`, `*.iml`, `*.ipr`, `*.iws`) are intentionally excluded from version control.** These files contain user-specific settings and workspace configurations that should not be shared across contributors.

If you're using a JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ, CLion, etc.), the project will automatically configure itself based on the `.editorconfig` settings. Any IDE-specific settings you need should be configured locally and will not be committed.

### Supported Editors

The project works well with:

- Visual Studio Code (with EditorConfig extension)
- JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, CLion, etc.)
- Vim/Neovim (with EditorConfig plugin)
- Emacs (with EditorConfig mode)
- Any editor that supports EditorConfig
