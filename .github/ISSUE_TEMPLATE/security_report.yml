        > **⚠️ IMPORTANT: For security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting instead of opening a public issue.**
        >
        > **Preferred method**: Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r/gold_digger/security) and click "Report a vulnerability" for private disclosure.
        >
        > **If you must disclose publicly**: Redact all exploit details, sensitive information, and proof-of-concept code. Only include enough information for the maintainer to understand the issue scope.
        >
        > **Contact maintainer directly**: For urgent or highly sensitive issues, contact [UncleSp1d3r](https://github.com/UncleSp1d3r) or email <unclespider@pm.me>.
