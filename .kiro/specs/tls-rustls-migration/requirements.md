# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature simplifies Gold Digger's TLS implementation by eliminating the native-tls dependency and standardizing on rustls-tls with platform certificate trust. The change reduces complexity while adding granular security controls for different deployment scenarios, from strict production environments to development setups with self-signed certificates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Gold Digger to use a single, consistent TLS implementation across all platforms, so that I have predictable behavior and fewer dependency conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gold Digger is built THEN it SHALL use only rustls-tls for TLS connections
2. WHEN Gold Digger connects to a TLS-enabled database THEN it SHALL use rustls with native certificate store integration
3. WHEN Gold Digger is deployed on any platform THEN it SHALL have consistent TLS behavior without platform-specific TLS libraries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Gold Digger to automatically trust my platform's certificate store, so that connections to databases with valid certificates work without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gold Digger connects to a database with a certificate signed by a CA in the platform trust store THEN it SHALL establish the connection successfully
2. WHEN Gold Digger runs on Windows THEN it SHALL use the Windows certificate store for trust validation
3. WHEN Gold Digger runs on macOS THEN it SHALL use the macOS keychain for trust validation
4. WHEN Gold Digger runs on Linux THEN it SHALL use the system CA bundle for trust validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with internal infrastructure, I want to specify a custom CA file for trust anchor pinning, so that I can connect to databases with self-signed or internal CA certificates while maintaining security checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide the `--tls-ca-file <path>` flag THEN Gold Digger SHALL use only the specified CA file for certificate validation
2. WHEN using `--tls-ca-file` THEN Gold Digger SHALL still perform hostname verification against the certificate's SAN/CN
3. WHEN using `--tls-ca-file` THEN Gold Digger SHALL still perform certificate expiration checks
4. WHEN the specified CA file does not exist or is invalid THEN Gold Digger SHALL exit with error code 2 (configuration error)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer connecting to databases with certificates that have incorrect hostnames, I want to skip hostname verification while keeping other security checks, so that I can connect to development databases with mismatched certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide the `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` flag THEN Gold Digger SHALL skip hostname/SAN verification
2. WHEN using `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` THEN Gold Digger SHALL still validate the certificate chain against trusted CAs
3. WHEN using `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` THEN Gold Digger SHALL still perform certificate expiration checks
4. WHEN using `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` THEN Gold Digger SHALL log a warning about the security implications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working in a test environment, I want to disable certificate validation entirely, so that I can connect to databases with completely invalid or self-signed certificates for testing purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide the `--allow-invalid-certificate` flag THEN Gold Digger SHALL disable all certificate validation
2. WHEN using `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN Gold Digger SHALL accept any certificate without validation
3. WHEN using `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN Gold Digger SHALL log a prominent warning about the security risk
4. WHEN using `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN Gold Digger SHALL still attempt to establish a TLS connection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the TLS security flags to be mutually exclusive, so that I cannot accidentally combine conflicting security settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide multiple TLS security flags THEN Gold Digger SHALL exit with error code 2 and display a clear error message
2. WHEN I provide `--tls-ca-file` and `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` THEN Gold Digger SHALL reject the configuration
3. WHEN I provide `--tls-ca-file` and `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN Gold Digger SHALL reject the configuration
4. WHEN I provide `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` and `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN Gold Digger SHALL reject the configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Gold Digger to maintain backward compatibility with existing DATABASE_URL configurations, so that my existing automation scripts continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gold Digger connects using an existing DATABASE_URL with SSL parameters THEN it SHALL establish the connection using the new rustls implementation
2. WHEN Gold Digger processes a DATABASE_URL without SSL parameters THEN it SHALL attempt a non-TLS connection as before
3. WHEN Gold Digger encounters URL-based SSL configuration THEN it SHALL ignore unsupported URL parameters and use CLI flags for TLS configuration
4. WHEN Gold Digger connects to a database THEN existing connection behavior SHALL remain unchanged except for the underlying TLS implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want clear feedback about TLS security settings, so that I understand the security implications of my configuration choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gold Digger uses `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` THEN it SHALL display a warning: "WARNING: Hostname verification disabled. Connection is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks."
2. WHEN Gold Digger uses `--allow-invalid-certificate` THEN it SHALL display a warning: "WARNING: Certificate validation disabled. Connection is not secure."
3. WHEN Gold Digger uses `--tls-ca-file` THEN it SHALL log the CA file being used for validation (if verbose mode is enabled)
4. WHEN Gold Digger establishes a TLS connection THEN it SHALL log the TLS version and cipher suite (if verbose mode is enabled)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TLS implementation to be feature-gated, so that I can build minimal versions of Gold Digger without TLS support if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gold Digger is built without TLS features THEN it SHALL compile successfully without rustls dependencies
2. WHEN Gold Digger without TLS support encounters a TLS-required connection THEN it SHALL exit with a clear error message
3. WHEN Gold Digger is built with TLS features THEN it SHALL include rustls-tls and rustls-native-certs by default
4. WHEN Gold Digger is built THEN the TLS feature SHALL be enabled by default in the default feature set

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user migrating from native-tls behavior, I want Gold Digger to handle certificate validation edge cases that worked with native-tls, so that my existing database connections continue to work despite rustls being more strict about certificate validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a database with an old/weak certificate that native-tls accepted THEN Gold Digger SHALL provide clear guidance on which override flag to use
2. WHEN connecting to a database using an IP address where the certificate only has hostname SANs THEN `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` SHALL allow the connection
3. WHEN connecting to a database with a self-signed certificate THEN `--allow-invalid-certificate` SHALL allow the connection
4. WHEN connecting to a database with default/placeholder certificates (e.g., "localhost" certificates on production servers) THEN the appropriate override flag SHALL allow the connection
5. WHEN connecting to a database with expired certificates THEN `--allow-invalid-certificate` SHALL allow the connection while `--insecure-skip-hostname-verify` SHALL reject it
6. WHEN connecting to a database with certificates using deprecated signature algorithms THEN `--allow-invalid-certificate` SHALL allow the connection
7. WHEN a TLS connection fails due to certificate validation THEN Gold Digger SHALL suggest the appropriate override flag based on the specific validation failure

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want all documentation and CI processes updated to reflect the TLS simplification, so that users and contributors understand the new TLS model and build processes work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TLS migration is complete THEN all README.md documentation SHALL reflect the rustls-only implementation
2. WHEN the TLS migration is complete THEN the TLS.md documentation SHALL be updated with new CLI flag usage examples
3. WHEN the TLS migration is complete THEN CI workflows SHALL test the new TLS flags and configurations
4. WHEN the TLS migration is complete THEN Cargo.toml feature documentation SHALL reflect the simplified TLS feature set
5. WHEN the TLS migration is complete THEN build instructions SHALL remove references to native-tls alternatives
