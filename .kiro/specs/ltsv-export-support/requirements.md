# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds LTSV (Labeled Tab-Separated Values) export support to Gold Digger, expanding the available output formats beyond CSV, JSON, and TSV. LTSV is a structured logging format that combines the simplicity of tab-separated values with labeled fields, making it ideal for log processing, monitoring systems, and data analysis workflows where field names need to be preserved alongside values.

LTSV format uses `label:value` pairs separated by tabs, providing a human-readable yet machine-parseable format that's particularly useful for streaming log data and systems integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to export database query results in LTSV format, so that I can integrate the data with log processing systems and monitoring tools that expect labeled field formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies an output file with `.ltsv` extension THEN the system SHALL export query results in LTSV format
2. WHEN the user uses `--format ltsv` flag THEN the system SHALL override file extension detection and export in LTSV format
3. WHEN exporting to LTSV THEN each row SHALL be formatted as `field1:value1<TAB>field2:value2<TAB>...` with tab characters as delimiters
4. WHEN a field value contains special characters (tabs, newlines, colons) THEN the system SHALL properly escape them according to LTSV specification
5. WHEN a database field contains NULL values THEN the system SHALL represent them as empty values in the format `fieldname:`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want LTSV output to handle all MySQL data types safely, so that I can export complex datasets without runtime panics or data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database fields contain NULL values THEN the system SHALL output `fieldname:` (empty value after colon)
2. WHEN database fields contain non-string types THEN the system SHALL convert them to string representation safely
3. WHEN field values contain colon characters THEN the system SHALL escape them to prevent parsing conflicts
4. WHEN field values contain tab characters THEN the system SHALL escape them to maintain field separation
5. WHEN field values contain newline characters THEN the system SHALL escape them to maintain row separation
6. IF type conversion fails THEN the system SHALL use debug representation format rather than panic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an automation engineer, I want LTSV format to integrate seamlessly with existing Gold Digger CLI interface, so that I can use it in scripts and CI/CD pipelines without changing my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LTSV feature is disabled at compile time THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message for LTSV format requests
2. WHEN using `--format ltsv` with non-LTSV file extension THEN the system SHALL respect the explicit format choice
3. WHEN the output file has no extension and no format is specified THEN the system SHALL NOT default to LTSV format
4. WHEN LTSV export encounters file system errors THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes consistent with other formats
5. WHEN using verbose mode THEN the system SHALL log LTSV-specific processing information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want LTSV output to follow Gold Digger's security and performance standards, so that it maintains the same reliability and safety as other export formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large result sets THEN LTSV export SHALL have the same memory characteristics as other formats (O(row_count × row_width))
2. WHEN credentials are present in query results THEN the system SHALL NOT log them in verbose output
3. WHEN LTSV export fails THEN the system SHALL clean up partial output files appropriately
4. WHEN using LTSV format THEN the system SHALL respect system umask for output file permissions
5. WHEN field names contain special characters THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without security implications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LTSV implementation to follow Gold Digger's code quality standards, so that it integrates cleanly with the existing codebase and maintains long-term maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing LTSV module THEN it SHALL follow the same `write<W: Write>(rows: Vec<Vec<String>>, output: W) -> anyhow::Result<()>` interface as other format modules
2. WHEN adding LTSV support THEN it SHALL be feature-gated with `ltsv` feature flag included in default features
3. WHEN LTSV code is added THEN it SHALL pass all quality gates (formatting, linting, testing) with zero warnings
4. WHEN LTSV functionality is tested THEN it SHALL include unit tests for escaping, edge cases, and integration with CLI
5. WHEN LTSV module is documented THEN it SHALL include doc comments explaining the format specification and usage examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Rust developer in the ecosystem, I want the LTSV writer functionality to be available as a standalone workspace crate, so that I can use it in my own projects without depending on the entire Gold Digger application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating LTSV functionality THEN it SHALL be implemented as a separate workspace crate `ltsv-rs`
2. WHEN the workspace crate is created THEN it SHALL be publishable to crates.io independently of the main `gold_digger` binary
3. WHEN designing the workspace crate API THEN it SHALL follow the same patterns as the `csv` crate with `Writer`, `WriterBuilder`, `Reader`, `ReaderBuilder`, and similar ergonomic interfaces
4. WHEN using the workspace crate THEN it SHALL provide both reading and writing capabilities with high-level convenience methods and low-level control similar to csv crate's approach
5. WHEN reading LTSV data THEN the crate SHALL parse `label:value` pairs and handle escaped characters correctly
6. WHEN reading malformed LTSV data THEN the crate SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
7. WHEN the workspace crate is documented THEN it SHALL include comprehensive examples and API documentation following csv crate documentation standards
8. WHEN the main Gold Digger binary uses LTSV THEN it SHALL depend on the workspace crate rather than inline implementation
9. WHEN the workspace crate is versioned THEN it SHALL follow semantic versioning independently of the main project
